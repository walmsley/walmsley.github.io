Augmented Imagination is the culmination of a six-week immersion in GAN steering, in which the artist experienced a melding of imaginations between human and machine. In this collection of videos, the eye of the artist is augmented to reflect the expansive range of imaginative possibilities made possible through this partnership with the machine. Augmented Imagination is part of an ongoing project to develop new techniques for harnessing the surreal output of GANs to fuse them with reality.
